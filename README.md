# The `current` ðŸŒŠ

**The current** is a micro-blogging platform akin to a personal Twitter feed that I created for myself, to post bite-sized updates.
In it's essence, it's a timeline of posts that can be both written and read quickly and on the go.

> DISCLAIMER!

> I got the original idea for a platform like this from [Linus Lee](https://thesephist.com/)'s [`stream`](https://github.com/thesephist/stream). This is basically my blatant copy of the concept written in Go, so I can better maintain and extend it for my needs.
